CV Generator

This React-based CV Generator allows users to input, edit, and preview their CV details, including personal information, professional experience, education, volunteering, and awards. It leverages React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for state management, and Context API for global state sharing between input forms and the dynamic CV preview. The application demonstrates a modular component-based architecture and CSS styling for interactive and real-time content updates.
